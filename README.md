# Animal Adventures

## Description
In the website, users are able to view a range of animals, they are able to create new animals with
specific fields required.  Users can also edit any animal and delete them from the website.  This a
simple website which will perform the actions above.

This website is also cross compatible whether the user is using their laptop, iPad or phone.

## UX
### User Stories
- As a user, I would like to create an account as then it would feel more personal.
- As a user, I would like to save my favourite animals in a separate section called Favourites.
- As a user, I would like to see some statistic or graphs relating to the data in the website.
- As a user, I would like to search for animal or key word which will bring up the animal(s).


## Framework
I have chosen to use Bootstrap 4 for the design and layout of my website.  Bootstrap is simple, 
effective and very efficient to use.

I have also used the Flask framework including jinja templates to also help me create this website.

For the font used, I have used Roboto from Google Fonts.  I have used this font as it is clear and 
can be easily read by users.

## Cloning and Pushing To The Respository
### Cloning 
- Here is a link how to clone a repository: 
https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository


### Pushing To The Respository
- To add, commit and push files to the repository, e.g. index.html, open a New Terminal and type:
1. git add index.html
2. git commit -m "Leave a message here"
3. git push origin master - (which is for the master branch).

- To create a new branch within your current application, open a New Terminal:
